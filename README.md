This is a cross platform app that enables you to get the bibtex entry from a DOI number, arXiv ID, article url (supports Nature journals, APS journals, PNAS, and more) or article title. It uses [doi2bib3](https://github.com/archisman-panigrahi/doi2bib3) as its backend. Written in Python, QuickBib is licensed under GPLv3.

#### Install from source with meson
Install the required dependencies, pyqt6 and [doi2bib3](https://github.com/archisman-panigrahi/doi2bib3). Afterwards, you can use meson to install quickbib.
```
git clone git clone https://github.com/archisman-panigrahi/QuickBib.git
cd QuickBib
meson setup builddir --prefix="$HOME/.local"
meson install -C builddir
```

To uninstall, 
```
meson uninstall -C builddir
```

### Windows
Prebuilt installers are available to download in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/archisman-panigrahi/QuickBib/releases/latest). Note that Windows smartscreen might complain because it doesn't know about this app and you would have to [manually bypass it](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-prevented-an-unrecognized-app-from-starting).

### Web App
A web app is available at https://quickbib.streamlit.app/.

### macOS

It is recommended that on macOS you use the [web app](https://quickbib.streamlit.app/) instead. _Continue reading to learn why_.

No prebuilt macOS installers: Distributing an app that users can graphically install and run seems to require paying Apple perpetually (US$99/year) to sign and notarize the app even if the app is free — that’s plain extortion — so we ship the source instead. You can run QuickBib from source or build a macOS app using the packaging scripts on GitHub. **If you have a better idea about how to package the macOS app in a more convenient way (without perpetually paying Apple), please let us know in GitHub Issues**.

You can install the app's dependencies with pip and run from source (**see below**).

## How to run from source? (works in GNU/Linux or macOS and perhaps also Windows with a little bit of tweaking)

1. Clone the repo and enter it

```
git clone https://github.com/archisman-panigrahi/quickbib.git
cd quickbib
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Upgrade pip and install dependencies

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run QuickBib from source

You can run the package module directly:

```
python3 -m quickbib
```

Or run the convenience script in `bin/quickbib`:

```
./bin/quickbib
```
